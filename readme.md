# Real Estate Cost Prediction

Real Estate Cost Prediction is a property/home price predictor. Users can estimate the current values of the housing, as home prices rise in accordance with demand and are affected by location. It uses a dataset to train the model and provide the predicted solution. This project basically focuses on house prices in Metropolitan areas. It mainly aims to provide a cost effective system to estimate the cost of property within a few clicks. Our project's motivation is to help users choose homes and real estate using our machine learning model.This model, which is trained using a training dataset to provide the best accuracy based on the technique utilized, can be used to predict real estate values. Transparency and trust in the real estate industry are highly valued by most customers, particularly in Metropolitan areas. These qualities can be re-established by setting fair and appropriate prices for properties. The project's goal is to estimate real estate sale prices based on a range of economic factors and to create an algorithm that can predict house values based on particular input features. We are using machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches.accuracy based on the technique utilized, can be used to predict real estate values.
